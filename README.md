# A Gallery of Art and Design

## Overview
This project is an **Interactive Image Gallery**, built as part of **Task-2 for my CodeAlpha internship**. It showcases a collection of images with smooth navigation and modal previews. The project uses **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript** for layout, styling, responsiveness, and interactivity.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Image Modals**: Clicking on any image opens a full-screen modal for a larger preview.
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover animations enhance the user experience.
- **Gradient Background**: The modal header is styled with a modern gradient effect.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup structure for the gallery and modal.
- **CSS3**: Styling, including custom gradients and hover effects.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Modal functionality and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic interaction for opening modals and displaying images.

## Usage
- Browse through the image gallery.
- Click on any image to open a full-screen preview in a modal.
- Close the modal by clicking the close button or outside the modal area.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more interactive elements like a slideshow feature.
- Implement lazy loading for faster performance.
